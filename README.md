ive created this program with visual basic(im still learning how to code!)

it is based on sound profile by https://sourceforge.net/p/equalizerapo/discussion/general/thread/98a5e135/

download WindowsApplication1/WindowsApplication1/bin/release/VEFXSlider.exe and put it in (EqualizerAPO installed folder)/config.
you can create shortcut to startup and desktop for quick access.

works best on equalizerAPO 1.1.2

sound profiles:
```
compressor(1~3) (extra bass)

echo(1~4)/reverb(1~3) (spacial sound)

echo ex(1~3)/reverb ex(1~3) (karaoke room)

chorus(1~3)/flanger(1~3) (disco stuff)

gargle(1~3)/distortion(1~4) (edm stuff)
```
click effector on/off button to turn it on/off
click vefx change button to change sound profiles
vefx slider controls strength/other mode of the current sound effect
low/hi eq slider controls low/hi eq lel
filter slider controls far side low/hi eq
volume slider controls volume


channel slider controls speaker channel mode (mono ~ 7.1 surround)
bgfx button disables background running effects.


sound profile will stay working even when program is closed. click OFF button to reset.
have fun!

my personal preference is: reverb 3 or ex3, loweq +3, hieq +3, filter -3, vol +3

this seems to do really good on turning mono into a lifelike stereo..
