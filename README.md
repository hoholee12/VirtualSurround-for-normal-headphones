# VirtualSurround-for-normal-headphones
no more surround sound gaming headphones needed, all you need is a EqualizerAPO(https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/) and this config.txt!

all handtuned by myself for hours.. ive finally found how to do proper virtual surround!

you can test if this virtual surround works with these links:

you can also tweak amount of woofer power you want but i suggest you leave everything default to avoid distortion
if you want that oomph while shooting guns.. try setting woofer preamp to -6dB
